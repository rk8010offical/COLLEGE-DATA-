# 🎓 Global College Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **global college data**, covering multiple aspects such as **placements, students, subjects, and sports participation**. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, we extract meaningful insights from the dataset to understand trends in higher education worldwide.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- **College Name** – Name of the institution.
- **Placement Rate** – Percentage of students getting placed after graduation.
- **Number of Students** – Total student strength.
- **Popular Subjects** – Top subjects offered by the college.
- **Sports Participation** – Number of students involved in different sports.
- **Global Ranking** – College’s position in world rankings.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We perform various **data visualization and statistical analysis techniques**, including:
- **Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values**
- **Understanding College Placement Trends**
- **Correlation between Subjects & Placement Rates**
- **Sports vs. Academic Performance Analysis**
- **Top Colleges based on Rankings & Placement Rates**
